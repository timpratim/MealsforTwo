# 🌰 Simple Sumac Onions

🧂 Ingredients:

1 large red onion (or 2 small), thinly sliced

1 to 1½ tbsp sumac

½ tsp salt (adjust to taste)

1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar (optional, for extra tang)

1 tbsp olive oil (optional, for richness)

A small handful of chopped parsley (optional, for freshness)

🔪 Instructions:

1. Slice the onion thinly – as thin as possible for best texture. Use a mandoline if you have one.


2. Massage the onions: Place the onion slices in a bowl with the salt. Gently squeeze and rub the onions with your hands for 30 seconds to 1 minute. This softens them and reduces their bite.


3. Add sumac: Sprinkle sumac over the onions. If using, also add lemon juice/vinegar and olive oil.


4. Mix and rest: Toss everything together. Let it sit for 10–15 minutes for flavors to meld.


5. Garnish (optional): Add chopped parsley just before serving.

🔁 Variations:

Add a pinch of sugar if your onions are very sharp.

Use white or yellow onions if you don’t have red—but soak them in water for 10 minutes first to reduce harshness.

For a more Iranian-style twist, skip olive oil and go heavier on vinegar.
