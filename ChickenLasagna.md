# Chicken Lasagna with Mushrooms & Creamy Béchamel

Ingredients

Minced chicken – 300g

Italian veggies mix (including mushrooms) – 250g

Pre-cut mushrooms (if not included in veggies) – 100g (optional)

Pre-cut garlic – 1 tbsp

White wine – 50ml

Passata (tomato sauce) – 500ml

Dry Italian herbs (oregano, basil, thyme) – 1 tsp

Chili flakes – ½ tsp (adjust to taste)

Salt & black pepper – to taste

Jumbo no-boil lasagna sheets – 6 to 8


For the béchamel sauce:

Butter – 50g

Flour – 50g

Milk – 450ml

Cream – 50ml

Garlic powder or minced garlic – 1 tsp

Black pepper – ½ tsp

Nutmeg (freshly grated if possible) – a pinch

Dried oregano – ½ tsp

Chili flakes – a pinch

Salt – to taste

Mozzarella (shredded) – 150g

Parmesan (grated) – 100g


Instructions

1. Prepare the béchamel:

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.

Add flour and whisk continuously for 2 minutes (to cook out the raw flour taste).

Slowly add milk and cream while whisking to avoid lumps.

Stir until the sauce thickens (about 5-7 minutes).

Add garlic, black pepper, nutmeg, oregano, chili flakes, and salt. Mix well and remove from heat. Set aside.


2. Cook the chicken and veggies:

Heat a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium heat.

Add minced garlic and sauté briefly until fragrant.

Add minced chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned.

Add the 250g Italian veggies + mushrooms. Cook for 3-4 minutes until softened.

Pour in white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom. Let it reduce for 2-3 minutes.

Add passata, dry herbs, chili flakes, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until thickened. Adjust seasoning.


3. Assemble the lasagna:

Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).

Spread a thin layer of béchamel on the bottom of your baking dish.

Add a layer of jumbo lasagna sheets.

Spread a layer of the chicken & veggie tomato sauce.

Spoon béchamel sauce over this and sprinkle some mozzarella and parmesan.

Repeat layers (lasagna sheets → chicken sauce → béchamel + cheeses).

Finish with a layer of béchamel topped generously with mozzarella and parmesan.


4. Bake:

Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.

Remove foil and bake another 10 minutes until golden and bubbly.


5. Rest and serve:

Let the lasagna rest 5-10 minutes before slicing to set.
