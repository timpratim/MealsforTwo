Instructions

1. Sauté Aromatics
Set pressure cooker to sauté mode (or medium heat). Add oil + annatto powder. When hot, sauté onion, garlic, spring onion, and chili for 2–3 min.


2. Add Tomato Base
Stir in chopped tomato and tomato paste. Cook for 2–3 min until it thickens slightly and the paste darkens.


3. Add Octopus & Spices
Add the thawed octopus pieces. Stir to coat in the tomato base. Then add:

Bay leaf

Clove

Allspice

Star anise

Cinnamon

Peppercorns

Thyme

(Whole chili if using)



4. Add Liquid
Pour in 200–250 ml water or broth (just enough to barely cover the octopus). Add lemon juice. Do not add salt.


5. Pressure Cook
Close the lid. Cook at high pressure for 20 minutes. Let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then open.


6. Reduce Sauce (Optional)
If the sauce is too thin, simmer uncovered for 5–10 minutes to thicken. Stir occasionally.


7. Finish & Serve
Remove bay leaf, cinnamon, star anise, and hot chili if used. Sprinkle chopped parsley.
Serve with white rice, fried or boiled plantains, and Creole beans on the side.
