# 🦀 Garlic Cajun Butter Crab Claws (for 2)

🧾 Ingredients:

500–600g raw crab claws (cracked with a hammer)

3 tbsp unsalted butter

1 tbsp olive oil (helps prevent burning)

5 garlic cloves, finely minced

1 tbsp Cajun seasoning (adjust to taste)

¼ tsp cayenne pepper or chili flakes (optional, for extra heat)

1 tsp lemon juice

2 tbsp water or stock (to help steam)

Salt, to taste (only if Cajun mix isn't salty)

Fresh parsley or coriander, chopped (for garnish)

Lemon wedges (to serve)

👨‍🍳 Method:

1. Dry the claws
Pat the cracked raw crab claws dry with paper towels. This helps them sear instead of steam.


2. Sear the crab
In a large skillet, heat olive oil + 1 tbsp butter over medium-high heat.
Add the crab claws and sear for 2–3 minutes per side, turning occasionally until they get golden spots and the shells start turning red.


3. Add garlic & spices
Lower heat to medium. Add remaining 2 tbsp butter and the minced garlic. Sauté for 30 seconds to 1 minute until aromatic.


4. Season
Add Cajun seasoning, cayenne (if using), and a splash of water or stock. Toss everything to coat well.


5. Steam to finish cooking
Cover the pan with a lid and let steam on low-medium heat for 3–5 minutes, until the crab meat is opaque and cooked through.


6. Finish & serve
Squeeze in the lemon juice, stir well, and taste for seasoning. Add salt if needed.
Sprinkle with fresh herbs and serve hot with lemon wedges and warm bread or rice to soak up the sauce.

✅ Tips:

If your Cajun seasoning already contains salt, go light on extra salt.

Don’t skip the steam step — cracked raw crab claws need the moisture to cook through evenly.
