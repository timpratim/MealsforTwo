# Garlic–Herb Lamb Chops (with sage leaves & rosemary sprig)

Ingredients

2 garlic cloves, finely minced or grated

1 heaped tsp Dijon mustard

1 fresh rosemary sprig (about 10 cm), bruised or lightly crushed to release aroma — you’ll remove it after marinating or cooking

3–4 whole fresh sage leaves (medium size) — finely chop 2 of them, keep 1–2 whole to place on top of chops while cooking for aroma

1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (or ½ tsp dried)

½ tsp finely chopped fresh oregano (or ¼ tsp dried)

1 tbsp finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (or 1 tsp dried)

1½ tbsp olive oil

½ tsp coarse sea salt

¼ tsp freshly cracked black pepper

Zest of ½ lemon (optional)

Method

1. Finely chop 2 sage leaves and the parsley, oregano, thyme. Mix these with garlic, Dijon mustard, olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon zest.


2. Rub the mixture all over the lamb chops.


3. Add the bruised rosemary sprig and the 1–2 whole sage leaves on top or around the lamb for aroma during marination or cooking.


4. Marinate 30 min at room temp or 4–6 h in the fridge (remove rosemary sprig before cooking if you want).


5. Cook as before: pan-sear 3–3½ minutes per side for medium-rare, or roast briefly if thick.


6. Let rest 5 min before serving.
