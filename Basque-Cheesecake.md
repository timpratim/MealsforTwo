Ingredients:

Philadelphia cream cheese: 200g

Heavy cream: 100ml

Sugar: 50g (adjusted for less sweetness)

Egg: 1 medium

Basque cheese (Idiazabal or similar): 30g, grated

All-purpose flour: 10g

Vanilla extract: 1/2 tsp (optional)

A pinch of salt


Instructions:

1. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 220°C (428°F). Line a small round pan with parchment paper.


2. Prepare the Batter:

In a bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth.

Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated.

Mix in the heavy cream, grated Basque cheese, vanilla extract (if using), and salt.

Sift in the flour and fold gently.



3. Bake:

Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is dark golden brown and the center jiggles slightly.



4. Cool and Chill:
Let the cheesecake cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours before serving.
