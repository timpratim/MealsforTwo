# Artichokes

In a large pot with enough water to submerge the artichokes:

1 bay leaf

Â½ tsp black peppercorns (about 6â€“8 whole)

Â½ tsp coriander seeds

2 garlic cloves, smashed

2 slices of lemon (or Â½ lemon, squeezed and dropped in)

1â€“2 sprigs of fresh herbs (thyme or parsley work great) â€“ optional

1 tsp salt


Bring the water to a boil first with everything in it, then add the trimmed artichokes and reduce to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 30â€“45 minutes, depending on size, until a leaf pulls off easily.

Optional Variation for a Subtle Spiced Kick

Add 1 small dried chili or 1 green cardamom pod, lightly crushed. Skip if you want to keep it mild or more classic.
