# ðŸ”¥ Roasted Aubergine PurÃ©e with Tahini

ðŸ§„ Ingredients (Serves 2â€“4)

2 medium aubergines (eggplants)

1â€“2 tbsp tahini

1 small garlic clove, grated or minced

ðŸ”ª Instructions

1. Roast the aubergines:

Oven method: Preheat oven to 220Â°C (430Â°F). Prick aubergines all over with a fork. Roast whole on a tray for 35â€“45 min, turning once, until skin is charred and they collapse.

Stovetop (for more smokiness): Char directly over a gas flame, turning until blackened and collapsing.



2. Cool and peel:

Let aubergines rest in a bowl covered with a lid or foil for 10 minutes (this steams them and makes peeling easier).

Peel the skins off. Drain off excess water or squeeze gently â€” too much liquid makes the purÃ©e runny.



3. PurÃ©e:

Mash the flesh with a fork for a rustic texture, or blend for smoothness.

Stir in tahini, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Adjust to taste â€” more tahini for creaminess, more lemon for brightness.



4. Serve:

Spoon into a bowl, make a swirl, and drizzle with olive oil.

Top with any garnishes you like (parsley, zaâ€™atar, pomegranate seeds).

âœ… Notes

Don't skip draining the aubergines â€” bitterness and excess water ruin the balance.

If it tastes flat, it's usually missing lemon or salt.

For a deeper flavor, add a spoon of Greek yogurt or roasted cumin
