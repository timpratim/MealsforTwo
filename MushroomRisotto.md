Instructions:

1. Prepare the mushrooms:

After washing the mushrooms thoroughly, press them gently (e.g. between paper towels or in a clean cloth) to remove excess water.

Collect and set aside the pressed mushroom liquid and combine it with your stock to enhance the umami flavor.



2. Warm the stock:

Heat your stock gently in a pot, including the reserved mushroom liquid.



3. Cook the mushrooms:

In your risotto pan, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat.

Add the mushrooms with a pinch of salt and cook until browned and most moisture has evaporated (5–7 minutes).

Set aside.



4. Sauté aromatics:

In the same pan, add the remaining olive oil (and butter if using).

Add the shallots and cook for 3–4 minutes until soft.

Add the garlic and cook for 30–60 seconds until fragrant.



5. Toast the rice:

Stir in the risotto rice and toast for 1–2 minutes, until the grains look slightly translucent.



6. Deglaze:

Pour in the white wine and stir until mostly absorbed.



7. Add thyme:

Add the thyme (remove stems later if using fresh).



8. Cook the risotto:

Gradually add the warm mushroom-infused stock, a ladle at a time, stirring frequently and allowing the liquid to be absorbed before each addition.

Continue this process for 18–20 minutes.



9. Add mushrooms:

Stir in the sautéed mushrooms during the final 5 minutes of cooking.



10. Finish:



Once creamy and al dente, remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan (if using), adjust seasoning, and remove thyme sprigs.


11. Serve:



Spoon into warm bowls, top with fresh parsley, and enjoy immediately.
