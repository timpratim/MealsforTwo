1 green chili (finely chopped) – optional

1/2 tsp cumin seeds

1 tsp grated ginger

1/2 tsp turmeric

1 tsp coriander powder

1/2 tsp amchur (dry mango powder) or a squeeze of lemon

Salt to taste

🍳 Instructions:

1. Prepare the filling:

Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle.

Add ginger and green chili; sauté 30 seconds.

Add peas and cook for 2–3 minutes.

Add all spices: turmeric, red chili, coriander powder, garam masala, amchur, and salt.

Mix in mashed potatoes and stir well. Cook for 2–3 minutes until cohesive. Adjust seasoning.

Add fresh coriander (optional). Let the filling cool.


2. Prepare the samosas:

Roll out puff pastry slightly to even the thickness (if too thick).

Cut into squares (~3x3 or 4x4 inches).

Place a spoonful of filling in the center.

Fold into a triangle or rectangle and seal edges with flour-water paste.

Press with a fork to crimp edges.


3. Air fry:

Preheat air fryer to 180°C (350°F) for 3 minutes.

Place samosas in a single layer (don't overcrowd).

Brush with oil/ghee or spray lightly.

Air fry at 180°C for 12–15 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown and puffed.

🥣 Serve with:

Green chutney (coriander-mint)

Tamarind-date chutney

Or even ketchup + chaat masala

📝 Tips:

Don’t overfill — puff pastry expands.

Keep pastry cold so it stays flaky.

You can prep them ahead and freeze uncooked. Air fry from frozen, adding 3–5 minutes to cook time.
