# Gochujang Air-Fried Tofu

Ingredients (2 servings)

400–450 g firm/extra-firm tofu (1 block)

2 tbsp gochujang

1½ tbsp soy sauce

1 tbsp rice vinegar

1 tbsp sesame oil

1–2 tsp maple syrup or honey (optional, balances heat)

1–2 tsp minced garlic (optional)

1 tsp grated ginger (optional)


For crisping (recommended)

1–2 tbsp cornstarch (or potato starch)


To finish (optional)

Toasted sesame seeds

Sliced spring onion


1) Parboil (no salt needed)

1. Cut tofu into 2–2.5 cm cubes (or thick rectangles).


2. Bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer.


3. Add tofu and simmer 2–3 minutes (extra-firm: up to 4 minutes).


4. Drain well, then pat dry thoroughly. Let steam off 5 minutes if you can.



2) Marinate

1. In a bowl, whisk: gochujang + soy + rice vinegar + sesame oil (plus optional sweetener/garlic/ginger).


2. Add tofu, toss gently.


3. Marinate 15–30 minutes (even 10 minutes works; longer is fine).



3) Coat for crisp (key step)

1. Sprinkle cornstarch over the marinated tofu.


2. Toss until each piece has a thin, tacky coating (not gloopy).

If it looks too wet, add a touch more starch.

If it looks too dry/powdery, add 1 tsp water or a small extra drizzle of soy.




4) Air-fry

1. Preheat air fryer to 200°C for 3 minutes (if your model preheats).


2. Lightly oil the basket (or use perforated parchment).


3. Arrange tofu in a single layer.


4. Air-fry 10 minutes at 200°C, shake/flip.


5. Air-fry another 6–10 minutes until browned and crisp on edges.



5) Serve

Finish with sesame seeds + spring onion.

Great with rice, cucumbers, kimchi, or a simple slaw.


Notes / troubleshooting

Too sticky / burning early: reduce gochujang slightly or add the optional sweetener only at the end (sugars brown fast).

Not crisp enough: dry the tofu more after parboiling, and don’t skip the starch.

Want it saucier: reserve 1–2 tbsp of the marinade (before adding tofu), simmer it 30–60 seconds in a small pan or microwave 15–20 seconds, then toss with finished tofu.
