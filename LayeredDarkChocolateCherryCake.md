## 🍫 Dark Chocolate Cherry Ganache Cake (Serves 3–4)

### 🧪 **Culinary Science Notes**

* The cake uses oil (not butter) for maximum moistness, and hot water to bloom the cocoa, intensifying the chocolate flavor.
* The cherry reduction uses acidity and natural pectin to create a jammy consistency without added gelatin.
* Ganache is made with a 2:1 ratio for a spreadable consistency at room temp.
* Layering and chilling enhance structure and flavor melding.

## 1️⃣ Dark Chocolate Cake

**Makes two 6-inch (15 cm) layers**

### Ingredients:

* All-purpose flour – ¾ cup (90 g)
* Unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-process preferred) – ⅓ cup (30 g)
* Baking soda – ½ tsp
* Baking powder – ¼ tsp
* Fine sea salt – ¼ tsp
* Granulated sugar – ½ cup (90 g) (seems like a cup but i's not too sweet)
* Brown sugar – 2 tbsp (25 g)
* Egg – 1 large
* Buttermilk – ⅓ cup (80 ml) *(or 80 ml milk + 1 tsp vinegar)*
* Neutral oil (e.g. grapeseed or canola) – ¼ cup (60 ml)
* Vanilla extract – 1 tsp
* Hot water (just-boiled) – ⅓ cup (80 ml)
* Espresso powder (optional, enhances chocolate) – ½ tsp

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat** oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease two 6-inch (15 cm) cake pans and line bottoms with parchment.
2. **Dry mix**: Sift flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.
3. **Wet mix**: In another bowl, whisk egg, sugars, oil, buttermilk, and vanilla until smooth.
4. **Combine**: Add dry ingredients to wet; stir until just combined.
5. **Bloom cocoa**: Add hot water + espresso powder and stir gently. Batter will be thin.
6. **Bake**: Divide between pans. Bake 22–26 min or until a skewer comes out with a few moist crumbs.
7. **Cool** completely before assembling. Chill for cleaner cutting/layering.

## 2️⃣ Cherry Reduction Filling

**Tart, jammy layer for contrast**

### Ingredients:

* Frozen or fresh sour cherries – 1½ cups (225 g)
* Sugar – 3 tbsp (38 g)
* Lemon juice – 1 tsp
* Kirsch (cherry brandy) – 1 tbsp *(optional, enhances depth)*
* Cornstarch – 1 tsp + 1 tsp cold water

### Instructions:

1. **Simmer** cherries, sugar, and lemon over medium heat for 10–12 min, mashing some as they soften.
2. **Add cornstarch slurry** to thicken. Stir 1–2 min until jammy.
3. **Finish** with kirsch. Cool completely before use.

🧠 *Cherry reduction relies on water evaporation and light starch gelation to hold its structure between cake layers. Avoid overcooking to prevent bitterness.*

## 3️⃣ Dark Chocolate Ganache (Pourable, Glossy)

### Ingredients:

* Dark chocolate (60–70%) – 100 g (3.5 oz), finely chopped
* Heavy cream – ½ cup (120 ml)
* Unsalted butter – 1 tbsp (14 g), for sheen (optional)

### Instructions:

1. Heat cream to just below boiling. Pour over chopped chocolate.
2. Let sit 1 min. Whisk from center outward until glossy.
3. Stir in butter. Cool slightly to thicken for spreading (approx. 20–30 min at room temp).

🧠 *A 1:2 chocolate-to-cream ratio makes a smooth, pourable ganache that sets softly for elegant slicing.*

## 🔧 Assembly

1. **Level** cooled cake layers with a serrated knife.
2. Pipe a ring of ganache on the bottom layer to contain filling.
3. Spoon in cooled cherry reduction (about ½ cm thick).
4. Top with second cake layer.
5. **Chill** 20 min to set layers.
6. **Spread ganache** over top and sides. Use an offset spatula for smoothness or swoops.

## ✨ Garnishing & Plating (Optional for Fine Dining Presentation)

* Fresh cherries or sour cherry halves
* Micro mint or micro basil
* Edible flower petals (e.g., violas or dianthus)
* Gold leaf or cocoa nibs for textural contrast
* Serve on a dark or white plate for contrast; drizzle extra cherry syrup around edges in dots or streaks
