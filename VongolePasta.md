Ingredients

250g spaghetti or linguine

500g fresh palourde clams (or vongole)

2 tbsp olive oil

2 small shallots, finely chopped

2–3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

½ tsp chili flakes (adjust to taste)

150ml dry white wine

A small bunch parsley, chopped

1 tbsp butter (optional, for richness)

Grated Parmesan, to taste (you already use it—go for it)

Salt (for pasta water)

Step 1: Clean the Clams Properly

1. Rinse under cold water, discarding any broken shells.


2. Purge the sand:

Place clams in a large bowl with salted water (approx. 35g salt per liter, like seawater).

Let them sit for 30–45 minutes, ideally in a dark place.

Stir occasionally. You may see sand settle at the bottom.



3. Scrub shells with a brush or hands under running water.


4. Discard any clams that remain open when tapped—they're likely dead.

Step 2: Cook Pasta

Cook pasta in well-salted water until just shy of al dente (it will finish in the sauce).

Reserve a cup of pasta water, then drain.

Step 3: Cook Clams & Build Sauce

1. In a large sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.


2. Add shallots, sauté 2 min, then add garlic and chili flakes, cook 1 min more.


3. Increase heat to medium-high. Add clams and white wine.


4. Cover and steam for 3–5 minutes, shaking occasionally, until clams just open.


5. Immediately remove clams from the pan with tongs—do not overcook.


6. Let the remaining liquid reduce by half, about 3–4 minutes.

Step 4: Finish the Dish

1. Add butter to the reduced sauce (optional, but it emulsifies nicely).


2. Toss in drained pasta, stirring to coat. Add a splash of pasta water if needed.


3. Return clams to the pan, sprinkle in chopped parsley, and toss everything together briefly to reheat.


4. Serve with grated Parmesan, even though it’s non-traditional—it works if you like it.

Tips

No need for salt in the sauce; the clams release briny liquid.

If using Parmesan, keep wine and butter well balanced—too much cheese can fight the brine.

Optional: add lemon zest or a squeeze of juice before serving to brighten it up.
