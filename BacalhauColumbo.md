🔪 Preparation

🧂 Prepare the bacalhau (if not already soaked):

1. Rinse off the salt, then soak in cold water for 24–36 hours, changing water every 6–8 hours.


2. Alternatively, quick method: boil cod in water 10–15 min, drain, rinse, and repeat once.


3. Remove skin and bones. Flake into large pieces.



🌶️ Make the Colombo spice blend:

1. Dry roast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fenugreek, mustard, cinnamon) in a hot pan until fragrant (1–2 minutes).


2. Cool slightly, grind finely.


3. Mix in turmeric and clove.



🍳 Cook the Colombo:

1. In a pot, heat oil. Sauté onions, garlic, scallions, and chili until softened.


2. Add the roasted Colombo spice mix and stir for 30 seconds.


3. Add potatoes, carrots, bell pepper, thyme, and bay leaves. Stir well to coat.


4. Pour in coconut milk and water/stock. Simmer covered ~15–20 minutes until potatoes are tender.


5. Add flaked bacalhau. Simmer gently 5–7 minutes more to meld flavors (don’t overcook fish).


6. Add lime juice and zest at the end. Adjust seasoning if needed.



🌿 To serve:

Garnish with parsley or culantro.

Serve with white rice, boiled plantains, or breadfruit.
