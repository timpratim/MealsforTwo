🧑‍🍳 Instructions

1. Marinate the pork
Mix all spices, juices, vinegar, achiote paste, garlic powder, chili, and salt/pepper into a marinade. Rub over speklap. Marinate 30 minutes or overnight.

Add sliced onion to the bottom (optional).

Add marinated pork + all marinade.

Add 75 ml water on top.



3. Cook

Lock lid.

Cook on high pressure for 15 minutes.

Quick release after 15 min (don’t let it sit longer — fat will burn).

Optionally, skim off excess fat from the liquid.

Mix meat back into the reduced sauce.
