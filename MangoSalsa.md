# ðŸ”¥ Spiced Roasted Mango Salsa

Ingredients:

1 ripe mango, diced

Â½ roasted onion, finely chopped

1 roasted garlic clove, mashed

1 roasted green chili (or to taste), chopped

Juice of 1 lime

Â½ tsp cumin powder

Â¼ tsp allspice

Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

Â½ chicken stock cube, crumbled (or a dash of concentrate â€” not too much!)

A small handful of fresh cilantro or parsley (optional, for freshness)

ðŸ¥£ Instructions:

1. In a bowl, combine mango, roasted onion, roasted chili, and garlic.


2. Add lime juice, then stir in cumin, allspice, and black pepper.


3. Crumble in half a chicken cube and mix thoroughly to dissolve it into the lime juice and roasted juices.


4. Taste and adjust:

More lime if too salty or heavy.

A splash of water if the cube made it too intense.

Optional herbs for freshness.



5. Let it sit 10â€“15 minutes for flavors to meld.

ðŸ§  Why this works:

Allspice + cumin bring Caribbean warmth.

Chicken cube gives umami depth â€” think of it like a cheat for cooking without reducing stock.

Roasted elements add smokiness to contrast the mango's sweetness.

Lime keeps it alive and balanced.
