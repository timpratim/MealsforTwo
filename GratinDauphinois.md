# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ¥”ðŸ§€ Gratin Dauphinois (600g potatoes)

Ingredients

600g waxy potatoes, peeled & sliced 2â€“3 mm thick

150ml heavy cream (full-fat)

75g crÃ¨me fraÃ®che (full-fat)

100ml chicken stock (hot)

1â€“2 garlic cloves, halved

20g butter (for greasing + dotting)

1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (or Â½ tsp dried)

1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

Â½ tsp dried oregano

Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg

Salt & pepper to taste

(Optional) 50â€“70g grated GruyÃ¨re or ComtÃ© for topping


Method

1. Prep the dish â€“ Rub the inside with cut garlic, grease with butter.


2. Slice potatoes â€“ 2â€“3 mm thick (donâ€™t rinse â€” starch helps binding).


3. Make the sauce â€“ In a bowl, mix heavy cream, crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, hot chicken stock, thyme, parsley, oregano, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.


4. Layer â€“ Arrange potatoes in overlapping layers, pouring some sauce over each layer. Finish with the remaining sauce.


5. Top â€“ Dot with butter; add cheese if you want a gratinated top.


6. Bake â€“ 170Â°C for 50â€“60 min until potatoes are tender and golden (cover with foil if browning too early).


7. Rest â€“ Let sit 5â€“10 min before serving so the cream thickens.
