# 🇮🇹 Traditional Carbonara (using 100g guanciale)

🧂 Ingredients (Serves 2 hungry people)

200g pasta (spaghetti, rigatoni, or tonnarelli)

100g guanciale, cut into strips

2 whole eggs + 1 egg yolk

50g Pecorino Romano, finely grated

Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste

Salt, for the pasta water (light, as guanciale and cheese are salty)



---

🍳 Instructions

1. Boil pasta water: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (less salt than usual, due to guanciale and cheese).


2. Prepare guanciale:

Add guanciale to a cold pan (no oil).

Turn heat to medium-low and slowly render fat.

Cook until crispy but not burnt (about 5–7 minutes).

Remove from heat and keep warm. Reserve the fat in the pan.



3. Make egg mixture:

In a bowl, beat 2 eggs + 1 yolk.

Stir in 50g Pecorino Romano and a generous amount of black pepper until smooth and creamy.



4. Cook the pasta:

Boil pasta until al dente (about 1 minute less than package says).

Reserve at least ½ cup of pasta water, then drain.



5. Combine:

Add drained pasta to the pan with guanciale (off the heat). Toss to coat with rendered fat.

After the pan cools a bit (~30 seconds), stir in the egg-cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to avoid scrambling.

Add reserved pasta water a spoonful at a time to emulsify into a glossy sauce.



6. Serve immediately:

Plate with extra Pecorino and cracked black pepper.

🧠 Notes

Do not use cream, garlic, onion, or oil—those are not traditional.

Sauce should be silky, not scrambled or dry.

Guanciale > pancetta > bacon (in order of authenticity and flavor).
