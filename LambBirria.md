Instructions:

1. Prepare the Chilies:

Remove stems and seeds from guajillo, ancho, and pasilla chilies.

Toast them lightly in a dry pan for 1-2 minutes.

Soak them in hot water for 10 minutes until softened.


2. Blend the Sauce:

Blend roasted chilies, garlic, onion, and tomatoes with 1 cup of the soaking liquid, cumin seeds, oregano, vinegar, and a pinch of salt until smooth.


3. Cook the Birria:

Heat vegetable oil in the pressure cooker on sauté mode.

Season lamb with salt and pepper, then sear until browned.

Pour in the blended chili sauce, stock, and add cinnamon stick, cloves, and bay leaves.

Close the lid and cook on high pressure for 45 minutes.

Allow natural pressure release for 10 minutes.


4. Shred the Lamb:

Remove lamb and shred it with two forks.

Simmer the sauce on sauté mode to thicken if needed, then return the shredded lamb to the sauce.


5. Assemble Tacos:

Heat tortillas on a skillet.

Dip one side of the tortilla in the birria sauce, then fill with shredded lamb, onion, cilantro, and optional cheese.

Fold and toast on the skillet until crispy.
