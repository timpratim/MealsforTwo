🔪 Instructions

1. Reduce the Peach

Dice the peach and place it in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Cook gently for 5–7 minutes, stirring often, until soft and reduced to a thick purée (~2 tbsp).

Set aside to cool.


2. Infuse the Cream

In another saucepan, combine cream, lavender, and vanilla.

Heat gently until steaming (not boiling).

Turn off heat and let steep 10–15 minutes.

Strain out the lavender.


3. Make the Custard

In a bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt until just blended.

Slowly whisk in the warm infused cream to temper.

Stir in the cooled peach purée.


4. Assemble

Pour custard into 4 ramekins (100ml each).

Skim any bubbles from the surface.


5. Bake (Cold-Start Oven Method)

Place ramekins in a deep baking dish.

Fill dish with hot water halfway up the ramekins.

Place into cold oven, then turn to 150°C (300°F).

Bake for 50–60 min, until set at edges with a slight jiggle in center.

Cool to room temp, then refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.


6. Brûlée the Tops

Before serving, sprinkle ~1/2 tsp sugar on each.

Caramelize with torch or under a hot broiler (watch closely).

💡 Tips

If you like visible peach bits, reserve some diced fruit and add it just before baking.

Don’t skip the chilling: the texture sets fully as it cools.
