# Pan-Seared Duck Breast with Ginger, Garlic, Green Chili, Scallions & Whole Spices

Fragrant, fiery, and packed with bold spice.

Ingredients (serves 1–2)

1 duck breast (327g), skin on

3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, julienned

1 green chili, thinly sliced (adjust to heat preference)

3 scallions, cut into 5 cm (2 inch) pieces, halved if thick

1/2 tsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed

1 small cinnamon stick

1 star anise

3 cloves

6–8 black peppercorns, lightly crushed

Salt, to taste

Optional: 1 tsp soy sauce or 1 tsp rice vinegar (not both)



---

Instructions

1. Prep the Duck:

Score the skin in a crosshatch pattern without cutting into the meat.

Season both sides generously with salt.

Let sit at room temperature for 15–20 minutes if time allows.



2. Render & Sear:

Place duck skin-side down in a cold, dry skillet.

Turn heat to medium and render fat for 7–9 minutes until skin is crisp and golden.

Flip and cook meat side for 3–4 minutes for medium-rare.

Remove and rest on a cutting board, loosely tented with foil.



3. Infuse Aromatics:

Pour off excess duck fat, leaving 2 tablespoons in the pan.

Lower heat to medium-low. Add:

Crushed coriander seeds

Cinnamon stick

Star anise

Cloves

Crushed black pepper


Toast 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add garlic, ginger, and green chili. Sauté 30–60 seconds until just golden.



4. Add Scallions:

Toss in scallions and stir-fry briefly — about 1 minute — until bright but still crisp.



5. Deglaze (optional):

Add 1 tsp soy sauce or rice vinegar, stir for 10 seconds to lift the browned bits. Remove from heat.



6. Serve:

Slice duck breast thinly against the grain.


Plate and spoon the aromatic mixture and oil over the slices.


# Crispy Duck-Fat Air Fryer Potatoes

Ingredients (for 2 servings)

400–500g potatoes, peeled or scrubbed (waxy or all-purpose, like Yukon Gold or Charlotte)

2–3 tbsp rendered duck fat (from your seared duck breast)

Salt, to taste

Optional extras:

Crushed garlic

Rosemary or thyme sprigs

Cracked black pepper or smoked paprika




---

Instructions

1. Prep Potatoes:

Cut into bite-sized chunks or wedges.

Rinse and soak in cold water for 10–20 minutes to remove excess starch (optional but improves crispness).

Drain and pat completely dry with a clean towel.



2. Toss with Duck Fat:

In a bowl, toss potatoes with the reserved duck fat, salt, and any optional herbs/spices.



3. Air Fry:

Preheat air fryer to 190–200°C (375–390°F) if needed.

Place potatoes in a single layer (don’t overcrowd).

Cook for 18–22 minutes, shaking halfway through.

Cook until golden, crispy outside and tender inside.



4. Finish & Serve:

Taste and adjust salt.

Serve hot — ideally alongside your sliced duck breast with those seared aromatics spooned over the top.
