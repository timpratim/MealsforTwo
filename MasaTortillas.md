# ðŸŒ½ Masa Harina Tortillas (for 2 people, ~6â€“8 small tortillas)

Ingredients:

200g masa harina (nixtamalized corn flour)

~275ml warm water (adjust as needed)

Â½ tsp salt (optional)

(Optional: 1 tsp neutral oil, like sunflower or vegetable, for extra pliability)



---

ðŸ¥£ Instructions:

1. Mix:

In a bowl, mix 200g masa harina with salt (if using).

Gradually add warm water, starting with ~250ml, and mix with your hand or spoon.

Add more water bit by bit until the dough feels like soft Play-Doh â€” moist but not sticky or crumbly.



2. Rest:

Cover and rest for 15â€“30 minutes to fully hydrate.



3. Form:

Divide into 6â€“8 balls (30â€“35g each).

Flatten each between two sheets of parchment or plastic (e.g., ziplock bag cut open) using a tortilla press or flat heavy pan. Aim for ~2mm thick.



4. Cook:

Heat a dry cast iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium-high heat.

Cook each tortilla for 30â€“60 seconds per side, flipping 2â€“3 times. It should puff slightly and get brown spots.



5. Keep warm:

Stack in a towel or tortilla warmer to keep soft and steamy.

ðŸ”§ Notes:

If the dough cracks when you press it, add a spoon of water and knead again.

If it sticks, itâ€™s too wet â€” dust with a bit of masa.

Donâ€™t overcook â€” theyâ€™ll get dry. You want them soft and pliable.
