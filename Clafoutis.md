🧑‍🍳 Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
Butter 4 x 100 ml ramekins and lightly coat with sugar.


2. Prepare fruit:

Pit cherries (3–5 per ramekin depending on size) and place them at the bottom of each ramekin.



3. Make batter:

Whisk egg and sugar until just combined.

Add vanilla, salt, and flour. Mix until smooth.

Whisk in milk and melted butter (plus optional rum/zest).

Batter should be fluid like crepe batter.



4. Assemble:

Pour batter over fruit in ramekins, leaving a few mm from the top.



5. Bake:

Place ramekins on a tray.

Bake for 16–20 minutes, or until puffed, golden, and set in the center.

A knife tip should come out mostly clean.



6. Serve:

Cool slightly, dust with powdered sugar.

Best served warm or room temp.

✅ Notes:

For softer texture, you can let the batter rest 30 minutes before baking.

Works with berries, plum slices, apricot halves, or even figs.

You can refrigerate leftovers and rewarm gently.
