Instructions:

1. Prepare the aromatics:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saut√© until soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for another minute.


2. Incorporate roasted vegetables:
Stir in the roasted bell peppers and chili, letting them warm through. Their smoky, roasted flavor will enhance the dish.


3. Add spices and passata:
Mix in the cumin and paprika, stirring to coat the vegetables. Pour in the passata and stir well. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of water. Season with salt and black pepper. Let the sauce simmer gently for 10 minutes.


4. Add the eggs:
Create small wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each. Cover the skillet and cook on low heat for 5-7 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your preference.


5. Garnish and serve:
Remove from heat and sprinkle with fresh parsley or cilantro. Add crumbled feta for extra creaminess, if desired. Serve hot with warm bread or pita for dipping.
