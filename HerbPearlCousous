🍳 Instructions:

1. Prep the preserved lemon:

Cut the preserved lemon in half. Scoop out and discard the soft inner flesh.

Finely chop the rind (both peel and pith). Rinse briefly if very salty.



2. Toast and cook the couscous:

In a saucepan, heat 1 tbsp oil or butter over medium heat.

Add couscous and toast for 3–4 minutes until lightly golden.

Add water or broth and a pinch of salt.

Bring to a boil, cover, then simmer for 10–12 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed.

Fluff with a fork and let cool slightly.



3. Combine everything:

In a large bowl, mix the cooked couscous with:

Chopped preserved lemon rind

Garlic

Herbs (parsley and mint)

Lemon zest and juice

Extra virgin olive oil


Season with salt and pepper to taste.



4. Let it sit (optional):

For best flavor, let the couscous sit at room temperature for 10–15 minutes before serving.
