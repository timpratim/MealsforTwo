Instructions

1. Pre-cook and Reserve Lardons and Mushrooms:

Set your pressure cooker to sauté mode.

Add the lardons and cook until they are crispy and their fat is rendered.

Remove the lardons and set them aside.

(If you haven’t already, sauté the mushrooms briefly until just softened, then reserve them.)



2. Brown the Lamb:

With the lardons removed, add the lamb chunks to the rendered fat.

Brown the lamb on all sides, ensuring each piece picks up a bit of that rich flavor.

Remove the browned lamb and set aside.



3. Sauté Aromatics & Spices:

In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, and garlic. Sauté for about 2 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften.

Add the dried chili, cloves, cinnamon stick, rosemary, and bay leaf. Sauté for another 30 seconds to release their aromas.



4. Deglaze & Build the Base:

Stir in the tomato paste and flour, mixing thoroughly with the vegetables and meat fond.

Pour in the red wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Let it simmer for 2 minutes.



5. Pressure Cook the Lamb:

Return the browned lamb to the pot.

Add the beef (or lamb) stock, then season with salt and black pepper.

Close the lid and cook on high pressure for 30 minutes.



6. Reduce the Sauce:

Once the pressure cycle is complete, perform a quick release.

Switch the cooker back to sauté mode and let the sauce simmer for 5–10 minutes until it reduces to your desired thickness.



7. Finish with Reserved Lardons and Mushrooms:

Stir in your reserved lardons and mushrooms, allowing them to warm through without further cooking.

Remove the whole spices (cinnamon stick, cloves, bay leaf, and rosemary sprig) before serving.



8. Serve:

Spoon your rich, spiced Lamb Bourguignon over a bed of creamy potato purée (recipe below) and enjoy!
