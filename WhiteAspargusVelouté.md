White Asparagus Velouté (for 2, rich and flavorful)

Ingredients:

500g white asparagus, peeled and trimmed

1 small onion or shallot, chopped

1 garlic clove (optional), chopped

1 tbsp butter or olive oil

~300 ml water or broth (start with less, adjust later)

2–3 tbsp cream or crème fraîche (optional, to finish)

A pinch of chili flakes

Salt and pepper to taste


Optional garnish:

Steamed asparagus tips

Extra cream or olive oil

Chopped herbs or croutons



---

Instructions:

1. Prepare asparagus
Peel the asparagus well and trim woody ends. Steam until very tender – about 20–25 minutes depending on thickness. Set aside the tips for garnish.


2. Sauté aromatics
In a pot, melt butter (or heat oil). Sauté onion and garlic gently until soft and fragrant.


3. Combine & simmer
Add chopped, steamed asparagus (minus the tips) and a pinch of chili flakes. Pour in about 300 ml water or broth—just enough to barely cover the veg. Simmer for 5–10 minutes.


4. Blend
Blend everything until smooth. If too thick, add a splash of water. If too thin, reduce a bit on the stove.


5. Finish
Stir in cream or crème fraîche if using. Adjust salt and pepper.


6. Serve
Pour into bowls, top with reserved tips, a drizzle of cream or olive oil, and more chili flakes if you like it spicy.
