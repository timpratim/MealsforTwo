## Tzatziki (serves ~3–4)

### Ingredients

* 250 g **Greek yogurt** (full-fat, thick)
* ½ large **cucumber**
* 1–2 **garlic cloves**, finely grated
* 1½ tbsp raisins, finely chopped
* 2 tbsp walnuts, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp **extra-virgin olive oil**
* 1 tbsp **lemon juice** or **white wine vinegar**
* Salt, to taste
* Optional: a little **fresh dill** or **mint**

### Step-by-step

1. **Grate the cucumber** (coarse side).
2. **Remove water thoroughly**
   Put the grated cucumber in a clean cloth or paper towel and squeeze hard. This step is critical—watery tzatziki is the #1 mistake.
3. **Mix yogurt + garlic**
   In a bowl, combine yogurt and grated garlic.
4. **Add texture**
   Fold in the squeezed cucumber, raisins, and walnuts.
5. **Season**
   Add olive oil, lemon juice (or vinegar), and salt.
6. **Rest**
   Chill for at least **20–30 minutes** so flavors meld.

### Texture & flavor tips

* Too thick? Add **½–1 tsp cold water** or more lemon.
* Too sharp? Add a bit more yogurt.
* Too garlicky? Let it rest—garlic mellows over time.

### How it’s traditionally served

* With **pita bread**
* Alongside **grilled meats or fish**
* As part of a **mezze spread**
* With roasted vegetables or potatoes
