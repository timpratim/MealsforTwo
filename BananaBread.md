# Banana–Chocolate Coffee Loaf

## Yield

1 × 9×5-inch loaf (about 10 slices)

## Ingredients

* Very ripe bananas, mashed — about 1 cup (240 g)
* Light brown sugar, packed — **1/3 cup (70 g)**
* Neutral oil (grapeseed/sunflower) — 1/4 cup (55 g)
* Unsalted butter, **browned and cooled** — 2 tbsp (28 g)
* Full-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream — **scant 3/8 cup (90 g)**
* **Strong hot filter coffee** — 1/4 cup (60 g)
* Unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch) — 1/4 cup (25 g)
* 70% dark chocolate, melted & slightly cooled — 2 oz (60 g)
* Large egg — 1 (50 g)
* Egg yolk — 1 (18 g)
* Vanilla extract — 1 tsp (5 g)
* All-purpose flour — 1 cup (120 g)
* Baking powder — 1 tsp (4 g)
* Baking soda — 1/2 tsp (2.5 g)
* Fine sea salt — 1/2 tsp (3 g)
* **Optional but recommended:** Ceylon cinnamon — 1/2 tsp (1.3 g)
* Dark chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate (60–70%) — 1/2 cup (85 g)

**Optional light coffee–chocolate glaze (not sweet)**

* 70% dark chocolate, finely chopped — 3 oz (85 g)
* Very hot filter coffee — 1/4 cup (60 g)
* Neutral oil — 1 tsp (5 g, optional for extra sheen)

## Method

1. **Prep.** Heat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line a 9×5-inch pan with a parchment sling; lightly oil.
2. **Bloom cocoa in coffee.** Whisk the **hot** coffee into cocoa until smooth; cool 5 minutes. (Hot liquid blooms cocoa for deeper chocolate flavor.)
3. **Wet mix.** In a large bowl, whisk mashed bananas with brown sugar until syrupy. Whisk in oil, **cooled** browned butter, yogurt, vanilla, egg, then yolk. Whisk in melted dark chocolate, then the cocoa–coffee paste.
4. **Dry mix.** In another bowl whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and **cinnamon if using**.
5. **Combine.** Fold dry into wet just until \~80% combined. Fold in chocolate chips until no dry pockets remain. Let batter **rest 10 minutes** (hydrates starch for a tender crumb).
6. **Bake.** Fill pan and bake **45–58 minutes** (reduced sugar sets a bit sooner). Done when a skewer near center shows a few moist crumbs (avoid a chip) **or** internal temp is **208–210°F (98–99°C)**. Tent with foil if browning too fast.
7. **Cool.** Cool 15 minutes in pan, then lift out and cool at least 45 minutes before slicing.

**Optional glaze:** Place chopped chocolate in a bowl, pour over hot coffee, wait 60 seconds, then whisk from the center to form a glossy ganache; whisk in oil for sheen. Drizzle thinly over the cooled loaf or swipe on the plate under slices.

## Why this works (quick science)

* **Moistness & tenderness:** Oil + banana pectin keep crumb soft; yogurt’s acidity tenderizes and activates baking soda.
* **Flavor without extra sugar:** Bloomed cocoa + brewed coffee amplify chocolate’s roasted notes, preserving balance at **70 g** sugar.
* **Lower sugar adjustment:** Less sugar lowers starch gelatinization temp, so the cake sets a touch earlier—hence the slightly shorter bake window.

## Plating (elegant & simple)

* Spoon a narrow ribbon of the coffee–chocolate glaze on a white plate.
* Set a slice slightly off-center; finish with **a tiny pinch of flaky salt**, a few **cacao nibs** for crunch, and **micro-mint** for color and lift.

## Storage

Wrap airtight; keeps 3 days at room temp (often better day 2). Freezes well (slice first).

Enjoy that deep banana–chocolate flavor with a gentle coffee backbone—and just-right sweetness.
