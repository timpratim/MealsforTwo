🧺 Method 2: Strained (Thick Labneh Texture)

1. Line a sieve with cheesecloth or a clean dish towel over a bowl.


2. Stir salt into skyr, then place it in the cloth.


3. Tie up the ends and refrigerate for 6–12 hours to drain whey:

6 hours → thick and spreadable

12+ hours → like soft cheese



4. Transfer strained labneh to a bowl. Stir in 1 tbsp za’atar and a bit of olive oil.
