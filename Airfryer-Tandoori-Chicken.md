### Juicy Air Fryer Tandoori Chicken Recipe

**Ingredients**:
- 4 bone-in chicken thighs or drumsticks
- 1 cup or 3 big spoons of plain yogurt (dairy-free for lactose intolerance)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp red chilli powder (adjust to taste)
- 1 tsp paprika (optional, for colour)
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves, optional)
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
- 1 tbsp mustard oil or any neutral oil
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
- Lemon wedges for serving

**Instructions**:

1. **Prepare the Marinade**:
   - In a large bowl, mix yoghurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, cumin, coriander, red chilli powder, paprika, garam masala, kasuri methi, black pepper, salt, and oil until well combined.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**:
   - Make 2-3 deep slashes on each chicken piece to help the marinade penetrate. Stuff some marination in these cuts.
   - Coat the chicken thoroughly with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for best results. In times of a quick meal, 15 min of marination works as well

3. **Preheat the Air Fryer**:
   - Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C) for about 5 minutes.

4. **Cook the Chicken**:
   - Place the chicken pieces in the basket in a single layer. Avoid overcrowding.
   - Cook for 20-25 minutes at 180°C, flipping halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred.
   - For juiciness, baste the chicken with melted butter or oil halfway through cooking
   - Then turn up the heat to 185 for another 2 min for the burnt flavour. 

5. **Serve**:
   - In a bowl add a spoon of cream, two small cubes of butter and some chaat masala and mix it up. Put the tandoori pieces right into the bowl after removing them from the Air fryer. Don't wait. 

Enjoy your flavorful, juicy tandoori chicken!
