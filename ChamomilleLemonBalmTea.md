ðŸŒ¿ Final Herbal Tea Blend

ðŸŒ¼ If using fresh herbs:

ðŸŒ¼ Chamomile:

6â€“8 fresh flower heads
(or about 2â€“2.5 g fresh)


ðŸŒ¿ Lemon Balm (MÃ©lisse Citronnelle):

10â€“12 medium-sized fresh leaves
OR

6â€“8 leaves + 3â€“4 tender flowering buds/tips
(or about 2 g fresh total)


ðŸ‘‰ The buds (flowering tops) are milder but aromatic, so you can swap them 1:1 for leaves if theyâ€™re young and not woody.

ðŸ«– Brewing Instructions:

1. Rinse herbs gently and pat dry.


2. Lightly crush lemon balm leaves/buds with your fingers to release oils.


3. Boil water, then let it cool slightly (~90â€“95Â°C).


4. Add herbs to a teapot or infuser.


5. Pour 500 ml hot water over herbs.


6. Cover and steep for 7â€“10 minutes.


7. Strain and serve.



Optional: add a few drops of honey or lemon if desired, but it's lovely as is â€” soothing, floral, and gently citrusy.
