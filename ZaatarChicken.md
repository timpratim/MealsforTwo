🔥 Cooking Options

1. Oven (Best for juicy inside, browned outside):

Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F

Shake off excess marinade and lay chicken on a lined tray

Roast:

Boneless thighs: 20–25 min

Bone-in: 35–40 min


Optional: Broil last 2–3 min for charred edges


2. Pan (Great for speed & crust):

Heat a nonstick or cast iron pan over medium-high

Add a little oil, then cook:

Boneless thighs: ~6–7 min per side

Breasts: 5–6 min per side, lower heat if browning too fast


Scrape and sear any yogurt bits for flavor


3. Grill or Air Fryer? Let me know — I’ll adapt for that.
