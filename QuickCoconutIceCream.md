# ðŸŒ´ Quick Coconut Ice Cream

Ingredients (for ~1â€“2 servings):

90â€¯ml coconut cream (16% fat)

2 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste)

1 tsp vanilla extract or a pinch of salt

Optional:

2 tbsp desiccated coconut for texture

1â€“2 tbsp condensed milk (for smoother texture and sweetness)

Lime zest, cardamom, or a bit of rum for flavor

Chopped mango, pineapple, or dark chocolate pieces for mix-ins



Steps:

1. Whip it (optional but makes it fluffier):
Use a small whisk or hand mixer to beat the coconut cream for 1â€“2 minutes until slightly thick and airy.


2. Sweeten and flavor:
Stir in sugar, vanilla, and any other add-ins (e.g. desiccated coconut, lime zest, etc.).


3. Freeze:
Pour into a small container (e.g. ramekin or cup). Cover and freeze for:

~2 hours for soft-serve texture

~4+ hours for firmer ice cream (let thaw 5â€“10 mins before scooping)
