# Coconut Passion Fruit Panna Cotta

Ingredients:

300 ml coconut milk (16% fat)

100 ml whole milk or cream (optional, for creaminess and better set)

40 g granulated sugar

1 vanilla pod (split and seeds scraped)

Peel of 1 small lemon (just the yellow zest, avoid white pith)

1 tablespoon white or golden rum

2 passion fruits (pulp divided)

2.5 g powdered gelatin (about 1 tsp) or 3 gelatin sheets

2 tablespoons cold water (for gelatin bloom)



---

Method:

1. Bloom gelatin: Sprinkle gelatin powder over cold water; let sit 5 minutes until soft. (Or soak gelatin sheets in cold water until soft, then squeeze out excess.)


2. Infuse flavor: In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, whole milk/cream, sugar, vanilla pod + seeds, and lemon peel. Heat gently until sugar dissolves and mixture is hot but not boiling. Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes to infuse flavors.


3. Remove solids: Strain out vanilla pod and lemon peel.


4. Add gelatin: Reheat slightly if needed, then stir in bloomed gelatin until fully dissolved.


5. Add rum & passion fruit: Stir in rum and pulp from 1 passion fruit (reserve other for topping).


6. Pour & chill: Pour mixture into molds or serving glasses. Refrigerate at least 4-6 hours or overnight to set fully.


7. Serve: Top with reserved passion fruit pulp just before serving.

This version has a fresh citrus-vanilla aroma layered under creamy coconut and tropical passion fruit, with the warmth of rum rounding it out. The lemon peel adds brightness to balance the richness.

If you want, I can also suggest plating or garnish ideas!
