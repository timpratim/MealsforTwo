Instructions:

1. Blanch basil:
Drop basil leaves into boiling water for 5–10 seconds, then immediately transfer to ice water. Drain well and squeeze out as much water as possible.


2. Toast pine nuts (optional):
Lightly toast in a dry pan over medium heat until golden, then let cool.


3. Blend:
In a food processor or using a mortar and pestle, combine blanched basil, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Pulse or pound until it starts to form a paste.


4. Add liquids:
Add lime juice and drizzle in olive oil while blending until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust salt, acidity, or oil if needed.

Use:

For pasta:
Do not cook the pesto. Toss it with cooked, drained pasta while it's still hot. Add 1–2 tablespoons of reserved pasta water to help emulsify and coat evenly.

For fish or chicken:
Spread pesto over cooked or lightly seared fish just before serving, or marinate for 10 minutes before baking.
