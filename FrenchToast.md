Ingredients (serves 2–3)

For the custard:

4–6 thick slices rozijnenbrioche (preferably a day old)

3 large eggs

120 ml (½ cup) milk

1 tbsp crème fraîche

1 tbsp honey

1 tsp vanilla extract

Zest of ½ lime

1–2 tsp dark rhum

Pinch of salt

Small pinch ground nutmeg

Small pinch ground cinnamon

½ tsp instant coffee or a splash of strong brewed coffee


For cooking:

1–2 tbsp salted butter


For toppings:

2–3 tbsp almond slices (toasted until golden)

2–3 tbsp chocolate chips

150 g strawberries, chopped

1 tbsp sugar (for strawberries)

Whipped cream (chantilly)

Method

1. Prepare the strawberries

In a small pan over medium heat, cook strawberries with sugar until they soften and the juices thicken slightly (about 5–7 minutes). Set aside.



2. Make the custard

In a shallow dish, whisk together eggs, milk, crème fraîche, honey, vanilla, lime zest, rhum, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and coffee until smooth.



3. Toast the almonds

In a dry pan over medium heat, toast almond slices until golden and fragrant. Remove and set aside.



4. Dip the brioche

Heat butter in a non-stick pan over medium-low heat.

Dip each slice of brioche into the custard for 2–3 seconds per side (don’t soak too long), letting excess drip off.



5. Cook the French toast

Fry slices for 2–3 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Keep warm while finishing the batch.



6. Assemble

Place the hot French toast on plates.

Immediately sprinkle chocolate chips over the warm slices so they start to melt.

Spoon the reduced strawberries over the top.

Add a generous dollop of chantilly.

Finish with toasted almonds for crunch.



7. Serve immediately

Best enjoyed while warm, with the chocolate still melty.
