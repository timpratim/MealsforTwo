Ingredients

Pasta (rigatoni, penne, fusilli): 8–10 oz (225–280 g)

Chorizo (Spanish style, cured) or fresh chorizo: 6–8 oz (170–225 g), sliced or crumbled

Cherry tomatoes: 10–12 oz (280–340 g), halved

Onion or shallot (optional but great): 1 small, finely diced

Garlic: 2–3 cloves, thinly sliced

Tomato paste (optional, boosts depth): 1 tbsp (15 g)

Cream: 1/2 cup (120 ml)

Milk: 1/2 cup (120 ml)

Pasta water: 1/2–1 cup (120–240 ml), as needed

Olive oil: 1 tsp (5 ml) only if needed

Black pepper: to taste

Step-by-step (the “won’t split” method)

1) Render the chorizo gently

1. Put a large pan on medium-low heat.


2. Add chorizo (no oil first). Cook 5–8 min, stirring, until it releases orange-red fat and the edges brown.


3. If there’s a lot of fat pooling (more than ~2 tbsp / 30 ml), spoon some off and save it for roasting potatoes or eggs.



Why: Controlled rendering gives you flavor without a greasy sauce.

2) Build the base

1. Add onion/shallot (if using) into the chorizo fat. Cook 3–4 min until soft.


2. Add garlic; cook 30–45 sec (don’t brown hard).


3. Stir in tomato paste (optional) and cook 1 min—it should darken slightly.



Why: Tomato paste “blooms” in fat, deepening sweetness and umami.

3) Burst the cherry tomatoes (your sauce backbone)

1. Add cherry tomatoes + pinch of salt.


2. Cook 5–7 min on medium heat until they collapse and jam up.


3. Mash lightly with a spoon to release juices.



Pro tip: If you want a more “restaurant” sauce, cook tomatoes until they look glossy and concentrated—not watery.

4) Cook pasta + reserve water (critical)

1. Boil pasta in well-salted water.


2. Cook to 1–2 min shy of al dente.


3. Reserve at least 1 cup (240 ml) pasta water.



Why: Pasta water contains starch that helps emulsify the chorizo fat with dairy = silky sauce.

5) Make the dairy sauce without splitting

This is the part that usually goes wrong—so do it like this:

1. Lower pan heat to low.


2. Add milk first, then cream. Stir.


3. Add 1/3 cup (80 ml) pasta water and stir until smooth.


4. Add drained pasta and toss 1–2 min to finish cooking in sauce.


5. Turn heat off and add cheese in 2–3 additions, tossing constantly.


6. Adjust texture with extra pasta water until glossy and clingy.



Why it works (science):

Chorizo fat + dairy can separate if the sauce gets too hot.

Starch + agitation create an emulsion (tiny droplets of fat suspended in water), giving you that creamy, unified sauce.

Adding cheese off-heat prevents grainy clumps and splitting.

Flavor upgrades (high impact, minimal effort)

Acid balance: A squeeze of lemon or 1 tsp (5 ml) red wine vinegar at the end lifts the richness.

Heat control: Black pepper + a pinch of chili flakes makes the chorizo taste “bigger.”

Herb freshness: Parsley or basil at the end for contrast.

Smoky depth: Tiny pinch smoked paprika (chorizo already has it—this amplifies).

Common mistakes + fixes

Sauce looks oily/greasy: Too much rendered fat. Spoon some off early; add more pasta water and toss vigorously to re-emulsify.

Sauce curdled/split: Heat too high after dairy. Fix by taking off heat, whisking in a splash of cold milk (2 tbsp / 30 ml) + pasta water while tossing hard.

Sauce too thin: Reduce tomatoes longer before dairy, or simmer 1–2 min after adding milk/cream before adding pasta (gentle heat).

Sauce too thick: Add pasta water 1 tbsp (15 ml) at a time until silky.

Plating like a restaurant (easy)

Use tongs to twist pasta into a tight nest in the center (focal point + height).

Spoon a few glossy tomatoes and chorizo pieces on top for texture/contrast.

Microgarnish: micro basil or pea shoots (fresh, green, clean).

Finish with a light dusting of finely grated pecorino and a tiny drizzle of reserved chorizo oil (just a few drops).

technique a lot.
