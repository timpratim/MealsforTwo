Instructions

1. Prepare the Coffee:

Brew your decaf coffee using a strong ratio (about 4 tablespoons of grounds per cup of water).

While still hot, stir in 1–2 tablespoons sugar until fully dissolved.

Let the coffee cool completely.



2. Make the Marsala Sabayon:

First, in a small saucepan over low heat, gently reduce 3 tablespoons of dry Marsala for 1–2 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.

In a heatproof bowl, combine the 2 egg yolks and 50g granulated sugar.

Place the bowl over a double boiler (a pot of simmering water ensuring the bowl’s bottom doesn’t touch the water).

Whisk continuously until the mixture becomes pale, thick, and roughly doubles in volume (about 5–7 minutes).

Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in the reduced Marsala. Continue whisking a minute more off the heat to ensure a smooth, airy sabayon. Let it cool to room temperature.



3. Prepare the Mascarpone Mixture:

In a separate bowl, combine the 250g mascarpone with 2 tablespoons honey. Mix until smooth.

Gently fold the cooled Marsala sabayon into the mascarpone mixture until evenly combined.



4. Assemble the Tiramisu:

Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the cooled, sweetened coffee (don’t soak them—just a quick dip to avoid sogginess).

Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish.

Spread half of the mascarpone–sabayon mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.

Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers and top with the remaining mascarpone mixture.



5. Chill & Finish:

Cover and refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 4–6 hours (or overnight) to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to firm up.

Just before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder.
