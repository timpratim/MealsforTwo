# Brown-Butter Miso Cookies

**Yield:** 6 cookies (≈50–55 g each)

## Why this works

* **Miso = flavor without sugar:** White miso (shiro) supplies glutamates and mild salinity that **reduce perceived sweetness** and amplify roasted/buttery notes.
* **Brown butter:** Maillard products from toasted milk solids add nuttiness and complexity so the cookie tastes fuller at lower sugar.
* **Mixed sugars:** A touch of **dextrose (or light corn syrup)** keeps centers moist (humectant), reduces crystallization, and slightly lowers perceived sweetness vs. sucrose.
* **Milk powder:** Lactose + milk proteins promote browning and tender chew.

## Ingredients

* Unsalted butter, for browning 6 Tbsp (85 g)
* Light brown sugar ¼ cup, packed (50 g)
* Granulated sugar 2 Tbsp (25 g)
* Dextrose (glucose) powder 2 Tbsp (20 g) **or** light corn syrup 1 Tbsp (20 g)
* White miso (shiro) 2 tsp (12 g)
* Large egg **yolk** 1 (18 g)
* Milk or water 2 tsp (10 g)
* Vanilla extract 1 tsp (5 g)
* All-purpose flour ¾ cup + 2 tsp (100 g)
* Skim milk powder 1 Tbsp (8 g)
* Baking soda ¼ tsp (1 g)
* Baking powder ⅛ tsp (0.5 g)
* Fine sea salt ¼ tsp (1.5 g) *(miso is salty—don’t add more)*
* Optional mix-ins: toasted white sesame 1 Tbsp (9 g) + black sesame 1 tsp (3 g) **or** 70–80% dark chocolate, chopped 2.5 oz (70 g)
* Flaky salt, to finish (optional)

## Method

1. **Brown the butter.** Melt butter over medium heat, stirring, until milk solids turn deep golden and smell nutty (3–5 min). Scrape **all** browned bits into a bowl; cool until just warm, 10–15 min.
   *Science:* Browning creates nutty aldehydes/ketones (Strecker/Maillard), boosting flavor intensity without sugar.

2. **Cream with sugars & miso.** Whisk in brown sugar, granulated sugar, and dextrose (or corn syrup) until glossy and slightly lightened (1–2 min). Beat in miso until smooth; it should emulsify with the fat.

3. **Add egg yolk + liquids.** Whisk in egg yolk, milk/water, and vanilla just to combine. Avoid over-aerating (too much lift → cakier texture).

4. **Combine dry.** In a separate bowl, whisk flour, milk powder, baking soda, baking powder, and fine salt. Add to wet; mix gently until a few dry streaks remain. Fold in sesame or chocolate, if using.

5. **Rest (crucial).** Cover and chill **at least 1 hour** (ideally 6–24 h).
   *Science:* Hydration reduces spread variability; sugars equilibrate; fat firms for better edge/center contrast.

6. **Bake.** Heat oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Scoop 6 portions (50–55 g each) onto a lined sheet, spaced well. Bake **10–12 min** until edges are deep golden and centers are just set with a slight dome. Tap the pan once at minute 8 for gentle deflation and crinkly edges.

7. **Finish.** Cool 5 min on tray, move to rack, and optionally add a couple flakes of salt.

## Sweetness & Texture Dials

* **Even less sweet (same texture):** Reduce granulated sugar to 1 Tbsp (12 g) and increase dextrose to 25 g total.
* **Crispier edges:** Swap 1 Tbsp (8 g) AP flour for rice flour and bake +1 minute.
* **Chewier/thicker:** Add +1 tsp (7 g) corn syrup or +5 g dextrose; pull 30–60 seconds earlier.
* **More miso forward:** Increase miso to 1 Tbsp (18 g) and reduce fine salt to ⅛ tsp (0.75 g).

## Substitutions

* **No dextrose/corn syrup:** Use all sucrose; expect slightly crisper, less chewy centers.
* **No milk powder:** Omit and add +5 g flour; color will be a touch lighter.
* **Gluten-free:** Use a 1:1 GF blend and add xanthan ⅛ tsp (0.4 g) to preserve chew.
* **Dairy-free:** Brown **vegan butter** (if water-based) gently, or use 70 g refined coconut oil plus 1 tsp (5 g) water to replace lost butter moisture.

## Troubleshooting

* **Too salty:** Your miso might be saltier; cut added salt to a pinch next time and/or drop miso to 10 g.
* **Spreads too much:** Dough too warm or under-rested; chill scooped dough 10–15 min before baking.
* **Cakey/puffy:** Over-creamed or too much flour; mix just until combined and weigh flour.

## Plating (elegant but easy)

Stack 2 cookies slightly offset on a matte plate, leave negative space, and add a fine line of **tahini–miso syrup** (1:1 tahini and warm simple syrup with a pinch of miso). Sprinkle a few black sesame seeds at the focal point; add a quenelle of **lightly sweetened crème fraîche** to cut richness.
