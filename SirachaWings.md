👨‍🍳 Instructions

1. Marinate the Wings

You’ve already marinated with lime juice, garlic, piri piri, and salt — great.

Let them sit no longer than 30 minutes in total (acid breaks down skin if too long).


2. Pat Dry & Coat

Lightly dab wings with paper towels to remove surface moisture — don’t wipe off the marinade, just remove wetness.

Toss with cornstarch (and optional baking powder).

Let them rest 5 minutes so the coating clings.


3. Air Fry the Wings

Preheat air fryer to 200°C / 390°F.

Arrange wings in a single layer, no stacking.

Cook for 24–28 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and crisp.


4. Make the Blue Cheese Sauce

Combine blue cheese, sour cream, mayo, garlic, and lemon juice or vinegar.

Add salt and pepper to taste.

Optional: thin with a splash of milk if too thick.

Chill until serving — this helps it thicken and mellow.


5. Make the Sriracha-Vinegar Glaze

Mix Sriracha, melted butter, and vinegar.

Optional: add 1/2 tsp honey or sugar to round out the acid.

Heat briefly (microwave 10–15 seconds) and stir until smooth.


6. Toss and Serve

Once wings are hot and crispy, toss them in the Sriracha glaze.

Serve immediately with the blue cheese sauce on the side or drizzled on top.
