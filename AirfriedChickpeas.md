# Air-Fried Chickpeas Snack

Ingredients (1 can = ~2–3 snack portions)

1 can chickpeas (240 g drained / ~1.5 cups)

1–2 tsp olive oil (or avocado oil)

1/2 tsp salt (start light; add more after)

Spices (pick one blend below)


The key to crispiness (don’t skip)

1. Drain + rinse the chickpeas.


2. Dry extremely well: spread on a towel/paper towels and pat dry.


3. Optional but worth it: remove loose skins (rub gently in the towel; skins come off easily).


4. Let them air-dry 5–10 minutes while you preheat.



Air-fry

1. Preheat air fryer to 200°C.


2. Toss chickpeas with oil + salt + only heat-stable spices (see note below).


3. Air-fry 12–18 minutes at 200°C, shaking the basket every 4–5 minutes.


4. They’re done when deep golden and audibly crunchy.


5. Cool 5 minutes (they crisp up more), then adjust salt and add any finishing spices.



Note on spices: Some powders burn (especially garlic powder, paprika) if cooked the whole time at high heat. If yours tends to burn, add them in the last 2–3 minutes, or toss after cooking.

Flavor options (choose one)

1) Smoky Paprika (classic)

1 tsp smoked paprika

1/2 tsp cumin

Pinch chili/cayenne
(Add paprika near the end if it burns in your air fryer.)


2) Garlic-Parmesan (very snacky)

After air-frying, toss with:

1–2 tsp grated parmesan

1/2 tsp garlic powder

Black pepper



3) Curry-Lime

1 tsp curry powder

Pinch turmeric (optional)

After air-frying: lime juice + extra salt


4) Sweet-Spicy

After air-frying, toss with:

1–2 tsp maple syrup or honey (tiny amount)

Chili flakes

Pinch salt



Troubleshooting (quick)

Not crispy: chickpeas weren’t dry enough; cook 3–5 minutes longer; don’t overcrowd.

Hard, not crunchy: overcooked; reduce time or drop to 190°C next time.

Spices taste bitter/burnt: add spices at the end or after cooking.


Storage

Best eaten same day. If they soften, re-air-fry 2–4 minutes at 190–200°C.
