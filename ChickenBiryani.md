Method

1. Marinate the Chicken

In a bowl, combine chicken, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, salt, turmeric, red chili powder, biryani masala, chopped tomatoes, fried onions, and mint.

Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes (longer for deeper flavor).


2. Prepare the Rice

Rinse basmati rice thoroughly and soak for 30 minutes.

In a large pot, heat ghee and oil. Add bay leaf, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, peppercorns, and lime peel. Sauté until fragrant (about 1 minute).

Add rinsed and drained rice. Gently stir for a minute to coat the grains in fat and spices.

Add water and salt, bring to a boil.

Cook on high flame for 6–8 minutes until rice is ¾ done (grains still firm in the center).

Drain immediately.


3. Layer and Dum the Biryani

In a heavy-bottomed pot, grease the base lightly with ghee.

Lay the thin potato slices evenly at the bottom.

Spread the marinated chicken over the potatoes.

Add a layer of half the cooked rice.

Sprinkle some biryani masala, mint leaves, and fried onions. (Add sliced boiled eggs if using.)

Add the remaining rice as the final layer.

Finish with more mint, fried onions, and saffron milk drizzled on top.


4. Dum Cooking

Cover the pot with a tight lid or dough seal.

Place on high flame for 8 minutes to generate steam.

Then lower the flame (or place a tava underneath) and cook on low flame for 10–15 minutes.

Switch off heat and let it rest (sealed) for another 10 minutes before opening.

To Serve

Gently fluff from the sides without breaking the grains. Serve hot with raita, salad, or a squeeze of lime.

Enjoy your richly layered, aromatic Chicken Biryani — crispy potatoes at the base, tender chicken, and fluffy saffron-kissed rice!
