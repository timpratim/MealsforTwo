🍳 Cook

Option 1: Pan-fry

1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan on medium-high.


2. Add chicken (with all the marinade).


3. Cook 6–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is nicely caramelized and cooked through.


4. If it thickens too much, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce.



Option 2: Air fryer (if you prefer cleaner cooking)

1. Preheat air fryer to 190 °C (375 °F).


2. Line basket with foil or parchment, spread chicken evenly.
